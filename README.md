## Install

```sh

```

## Usage

Lighthouse Keeper is built on [Codechecks](https://codechecks.io) â€”Â new open source code review
automation platform.

To use it, you need to install Codechecks GitHub App on a given repository and copy project secret
to your CI environment.

## Step by step guide

1. Install codechecks client and lighthouse-keeper:

```
npm install --save-dev @codechecks/client @codechecks/lighthouse-keeper
```

2. Create `codechecks.yml` file in a root of your project. It serves as a central configuration for
   all different codechecks plugins.

```yml
checks:
  - name: lighthouse-keeper
    options:
      buildPath: ./build
```

You might want to adjust the build path. To learn about all configuration options check out API
section of this document. We can dry run `lighthouse-keeper` locally. Just make sure that your build
exists and run `npx codechecks`.

Now we need to make sure that it runs on CI.

3. Visit [app.codechecks.io](https://app.codechecks.io).
4. Login with you github account and install Codechecks Github App on a desired repositories. Note:
   We don't have access to your code.
5. Find your project on the list and copy secret.
6. Add new environment variable to your CI configuration `CC_SECRET= <COPIED_SECRET>`.
7. Run `npx codechecks` as part of your CI pipeline after building the app.
8. That's it! ðŸ”¥Create your first PR and let codechecks record initial baseline. With Codechecks you
   can track build size, visual regressions and much more! Check out other plugins at
